     <div class="about_b_l">
       <p>We're changing because the world is changing. From
West to East. More connected, more complex. Less
certain, less clear. Exhilarating and liberating.</p>
       <p>Our clients need a brand consultancy that lives in the
new world order. One that can help them discover
where they fit, focus on what they're good at, define
where they're going, and why they matter. One that
can help define their Purpose.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="about_b_r">
       <p>In a world where narrow focus on shareholder value
is bankrupt, Purpose guides long-term decisions.
As everything speeds up, Purpose stabilises. When
technology creates total transparency, Purpose keeps
the whole business true. As your world becomes
a tangled network of competitors, customer and
collaborators, Purpose tells everyone where you fit.</p>
<p>
Purpose is everything. If you've got it, you can change
your world.</p>
